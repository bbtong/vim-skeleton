# vim-skeleton

Replace your empty or cluttered `.vimrc` file with this. Spring cleaning :)

## How to use

Copy the files contents, paste into your `.vimrc` file found at `~/.vimrc`. You can open it with any editor of your choice.

## Disclaimer

I am not responsible for you screwing up for computer if you don't know how to edit a `.vimrc` file properly.

## License

Don't steal this and claim it's yours, but it's just a list of plugins anyway. Why would you do that?
